## Setup TDX Guest Image

### Create EFI Cloud Image

The default cloud image for RHEL 8.7  does not support EFI schema, so it needs
to create customized EFI based RHEL 8.7 image via [TDX Guest Image Tool](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/tree/2022ww49/build/rhel-8/guest-image).

The tool provides scripts to generate guest image for RHEL. In this section, it takes RHEL 8.7 as an example.

For Ubuntu 22.04 guest image, please refer to https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/blob/2022ww49/build/ubuntu-22.04/README.md

### Prerequisite

- Install required packages:

  ```
  sudo dnf install -y virt-install libguestfs-tools-c
  ```

- TDX guest RPM repository was already generated by [build-repo.sh](https://github.com/intel/tdx-tools/tree/2022ww49/build/rhel-8/build-repo.sh)

- Make sure `libvirtd` service and the default `virbr0` interface works normal via

  ```
  systemctl status libvirtd
  ifconfig virbr0
  ```

### Install Guest Image With ISO Installer

Generate guest image td-guest-rhel-8.7.qcow2:

```
cd tdx-tools/build/rhel-8/guest-image/
./create-efi-img.sh
```

_NOTE:_

- For RHEL-8 image, please prepare RHEL 8.7 base ISO image and put it under the same directory as `create-efi-img.sh`. You can download RHEL .6 base ISO image from
<https://access.redhat.com/downloads>
Modify `create-efi-img.sh` and set the ISO variable to the image name as below.
Then run `create-efi-img.sh` to create the RHEL 8.7 guest image.

  ```
  ISO="RHEL-8.7.0-20221013.1-x86_64-dvd1.iso"
  ```

- For Ubuntu 22.04, default cloud image from [official portal](https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/) already supports the EFI boot, so just download from it.

### Install TDX Guest Stack into the Guest Image

Install tdx-guest-grub2, tdx-guest-shim and tdx-guest-kernel:

```
./tdx-guest-stack.sh
```

_NOTE:_

- It will copy TDX guest repo to target guest image and install the guest
packages
- Use the existing host environment in the guest. Such as /etc/environment,
/etc/chrony.conf
- This script can be used as an example of how to install necessary guest
components if a custom image is wanted.
